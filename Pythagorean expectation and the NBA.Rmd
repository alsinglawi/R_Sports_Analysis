# Pythagorean Expectation and the NBA
The NBA is the most popular basketball league in the world, and consists of 30 teams playing
an 82 game regular season followed by playoffs to determine the champion. In terms of scale,
this data looks much more like MLB data than the IPL data we just looked at.
Basketball resembles cricket in one way - the scores are much higher than in baseball. However,
the points difference between winning and losing teams tend to be relatively small.

Letâ€™s see what we find this time. We follow the same procedure

## Load the packages
```{r Loading packages, include=FALSE}
options(warn = -1)
library("readxl",quietly = TRUE)
library("tidyverse",quietly = TRUE)
library("dplyr",quietly = TRUE)
library("ggplot2",quietly = TRUE)
```
